## 1. Template System

**Documentation:** [`core/parser/README.md`](core/parser/README.md)

### 1.1 Liquid Parser

| Feature | Status |
| ------- | ------ |
| Tokenizer (raw text → tokens) | Done |
| Parser (tokens → AST) | Done |
| Renderer (AST → HTML) | Done |
| Template file resolver for includes | Done |
| Control flow (if/elsif/else, unless, case/when) | Done |
| Iteration (for/endfor with forloop, limit, offset, reversed) | Done |
| Variables (assign, capture, dot-notation access) | Done |
| Partials (render tag with variable passing) | Done |
| Comments (inline #, comment/endcomment) | Done |
| Raw blocks (raw/endraw) | Done |
| Filters (pipe chains in output and assign) | Not started |
| Whitespace control (`{{-`, `-}}`, `{%-`, `-%}`) | Not started |
| Additional tags (cycle, tablerow, increment/decrement, echo) | Not started |

### 1.2 Frontmatter Parser

| Feature | Status |
| ------- | ------ |

| Registration in global data (`collections.posts` from `loadDataFiles()`) | Done |
| Access via `collections.posts` in Liquid | Done |
| Permalink URL from pattern (full Liquid/date filter semantics) | In progress — see TODOs in `core/data/posts.ts` |
| Per-post output pages matching Eleventy permalinks | Not started (see section 6.4, build output parity) |

---

## 6. Migration Tasks

### 6.1 Template Updates

**Blocked by:** Render scope (Phase 2)

Update `src/_includes/` files to work with isolated render scope:

| File | Status | Required Variables |
| ---- | ------ | ------------------ |
| `page-footer.liquid` | Blocked | `site.email`, `socialnetworks.*`, `pkg.version` |
| `page-scripts.liquid` | Blocked | `pkg.version`, `site.timestamp` |
| `menu.liquid` | Blocked | `title` |
| `meta-head.liquid` | Blocked | `site.*`, `page.*`, `pkg.*`, `eleventy.*`, `keywords`, `pageClass` |

`pkg` keys listed in `customDataMapping` (e.g. `version`, `author` from `package.json`) are available from `loadDataFiles()`; templates remain blocked until render scope and the other variables above are wired.

### 6.2 Directory Name Resolution

**Issue:** `src/_includes/` vs `config.DIRECTORIES.INTERNAL.INCLUDES = 'includes'`

| Task | Status |
| ---- | ------ |
| Decide: rename `src/_includes/` → `src/includes/` OR update config to `'_includes'` | Not started |
| Update resolver if needed | Not started |
| Verify test fixtures match | Not started |

### 6.3 Dependency Removal

**Phase 5 - Cleanup** (only after full feature parity)

| Task | Status |
| ---- | ------ |
| Remove `@11ty/eleventy` and plugins | Blocked |
| Remove `postcss`, `postcss-cli`, `postcss-import` | Blocked |
| Remove `autoprefixer`, `cssnano` | Blocked |
| Remove `html-minifier` | Blocked |
| Remove `cross-env` | Blocked |
| Update package.json scripts | Blocked |
| Archive `eleventy.config.js` for reference | Blocked |

### 6.4 Build output parity (`_site` vs `.build`)

Append a row when you re-run the comparison (`find _site -type f | wc -l` and `find .build -type f | wc -l`).

| Date | `_site` files | `.build` files | Notes |
| ---- | ------------- | -------------- | ----- |
| 2026-03-30 | ~95 | ~88 | Same passthrough assets (fonts, images, certifications, favicon, CSS tree, top-level pages, `feed.xml`, `humans.txt`) |
| 2026-04-13 | 95 | 90 | `_site` built from `343c380` (last Eleventy-compatible commit). Gap is 5 external post pages. Script path resolved. Eleventy build broken on current HEAD (render syntax incompatible). |

Gaps:

| Gap | Notes | Status |
| --- | ----- | ------ |
| External post pages (5 files) | SSG skips posts with `external:` frontmatter (`core/emitter/posts.ts:27`). Eleventy generates a local page for each. All five are 2016 guest articles on SitePoint. Decide: emit a redirect/stub page, or skip intentionally. | Not started |
| HTML minification | `.build` output is unminified (e.g. `index.html`: 785 lines / 35 KB vs Eleventy's single-line / 32 KB). Phase 3 task. | Not started |
| Eleventy build broken on current source | Render syntax change in `759bfd3` (`{% render world.html %}` → `{% render "world.html" %}`) is incompatible with Eleventy's LiquidJS. Expected during migration — future comparisons require building Eleventy from a prior commit or the comparison becomes obsolete once migration completes. | Expected |
| Script output path | `_site` exposes JS at `assets/scripts/*.js`. `.build` writes `scripts/*.js` at the output root — templates and passthrough must agree so `src` in HTML matches deployment | Done |
| Individual post HTML (non-external) | `_site` has one page per post under `writes/:year/:slug/index.html`. `.build` now emits the two 2015 posts correctly. Only the five external posts differ (see row above). | Done |

## 7. Code Quality & Architecture

### 7.1 Architecture: Split `compile()` into a pipeline

`core/parser/index.ts` — `compile()` handles frontmatter extraction, output path resolution, context creation, Liquid parsing, rendering, and layout resolution in one function. Before adding filters, markdown, or HTML minification (Phase 3), decompose into composable pipeline steps so new processing stages can be inserted without growing the function further.

| Task | Status | File |
| ---- | ------ | ---- |
| Extract frontmatter step | Not started | `core/parser/index.ts:63` |
| Extract output path resolution step | Not started | `core/parser/index.ts:73` |
| Extract context creation step | Not started | `core/parser/index.ts:76` |
| Extract layout resolution into its own step | Not started | `core/parser/index.ts:90` |
| Define shared pipeline state type | Not started | `core/parser/index.ts` |

### 7.2 Architecture: Separate file discovery from processing in `traverseDir`

`core/emitter/traverse.ts` — `traverseDir()` mixes directory walking, file reading, compilation, and writing into a single recursive function. Splitting discovery (which files exist) from processing (compile + write) would simplify testing, enable parallel file processing later, and make the flow easier to follow.

| Task | Status | File |
| ---- | ------ | ---- |
| Extract file discovery into a standalone function returning a file list | Not started | `core/emitter/traverse.ts:23` |
| Move compile + write into a separate processing step | Not started | `core/emitter/traverse.ts:70` |

### 7.3 Type Safety: Remove `as` casts where narrowing suffices

The parser uses `as TokenIdent` / `as TokenKeyword` casts *before* the runtime type check on the next line. If the value is `undefined`, the cast silently lies. Check first, then the type is narrowed automatically.

| Task | Status | File |
| ---- | ------ | ---- |
| `variable` cast in `parseForHeader` | Not started | `core/parser/liquid/parser.ts:396` |
| `inKeyword` cast in `parseForHeader` | Not started | `core/parser/liquid/parser.ts:406` |
| `nameToken` cast in `capture` branch | Not started | `core/parser/liquid/parser.ts:497` |
| `params` cast in for-loop param parsing | Not started | `core/parser/liquid/parser.ts:630` |

### 7.4 Type Safety: Narrow catch-block errors

Several catch blocks access `.code` on an untyped `error` without narrowing. Add an `isErrnoException` type guard (or inline narrowing) so `error.code` access is safe.

| Task | Status | File |
| ---- | ------ | ---- |
| Add `isErrnoException` guard to `core/utils/` | Not started | — |
| Use guard in `readOrImport` catch | Not started | `core/data/loader.ts:28` |

### 7.5 Type Safety: Replace `as Record<string, unknown>` casts in data loader

`loadFromDir` and `loadFromFile` cast `readOrImport` results with `as Record<string, unknown>`. Add a type guard (`isRecord`) so malformed data (arrays, primitives) is caught instead of silently accepted.

| Task | Status | File |
| ---- | ------ | ---- |
| Add `isRecord` type guard | Not started | `core/data/loader.ts` |
| Apply in `loadFromDir` | Not started | `core/data/loader.ts:54` |
| Apply in `loadFromFile` | Not started | `core/data/loader.ts:67` |

### 7.6 Robustness: Validate `parseFilename` date parts

`core/data/posts.ts:30` — `parseFilename` splits the filename and maps to `Number`. If a filename doesn't follow `YYYY-MM-DD-slug`, the date parts are `NaN` and `new Date(NaN, NaN, NaN)` silently propagates an Invalid Date.

| Task | Status | File |
| ---- | ------ | ---- |
| Add `NaN` guard after parsing year/month/day | Not started | `core/data/posts.ts:31` |

### 7.7 Performance: Optimise for-loop param application order

`core/parser/liquid/renderer.ts:227` — `toReversed()`, `slice(offset)`, `slice(0, limit)` each create a new array. Applying offset/limit first (smaller array) then reversing reduces allocations for large collections.

| Task | Status | File |
| ---- | ------ | ---- |
| Reorder param application: offset → limit → reversed | Not started | `core/parser/liquid/renderer.ts:226` |

### 7.8 Test Coverage: Add tests for untested modules

The parser and utility modules are well covered. The integration layer (build, traverse, data, posts) has no dedicated tests.

| Module | Risk | Status |
| ------ | ---- | ------ |
| `core/data/posts.ts` (date parsing, URL generation) | Medium | Not started |
| `core/data/loader.ts` (file loading, error paths) | Medium | Not started |
| `core/data/index.ts` (data merging, `pickValues`) | Medium | Not started |
| `core/emitter/traverse.ts` (file processing) | High | Not started |
| `core/emitter/posts.ts` (post compilation) | Medium | Not started |
| `core/server.ts` (request handling, 404 paths) | Medium | Not started |

## Build Order Recommendation

1. **Complete Template Features** (Phase 2)
   - Filters (especially `dateToRFC3339`, `encodeXML`)
   - Collections parity (per-post pages, permalinks, URL helpers — `core/data/posts.ts`)
   - Shortcodes system

2. **CSS Processing** (Phase 3)
   - CSS Parser (shared dependency)
   - CSS @import Resolver (most important)
   - CSS Minifier
   - Autoprefixer (optional, evaluate if needed)

3. **HTML Minification** (Phase 3)
   - HTML Parser
   - HTML Minifier

4. **Markdown Parser** (if not done)
   - Full parser implementation
   - Integration with frontmatter

5. **Syntax Highlighting** (Phase 3)
   - Start with languages used in blog
   - Expand as needed

6. **Developer Experience** (Phase 4)
   - File watcher
   - Dev server with live reload

7. **Final Cleanup** (Phase 5)
   - Remove all dependencies
   - Update documentation

---

## Notes

- **CSS Autoprefixer:** Evaluate if needed. Modern browsers support most CSS features without prefixes.
- **Language Grammars:** Syntax highlighting requires significant work. Start with actively used languages.
- **Shared Parsers:** CSS Parser is a dependency for multiple components - build it first and reuse.
- **Testing:** Test each component with actual site content before moving to next.
- **Compatibility:** Website must work identically after migration (see AGENT.md).
