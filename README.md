Source code of my personal website [moritz.berlin](https://moritz.berlin). Build with [11ty](https://www.11ty.dev/).

### Versioning

I use custom versioning for my website, because it will just be relevant to me anyway agnd I wanted a system I can easily translate to the changes I usually make. I've used SemVer for a while but always struggled with it (_Is rewriting a full content section a major or minor change?_).

The current format goes like: `Year.Month.Commits.Type`, with the following possible types `M1 (Major)`, `M2 (Minor)`, `P0 (Patch)`.
